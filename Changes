1.5  May 28, 2001 by Josh Carter
	 - Major update with "real" JFIF parsing and can also
	 create/modify/save IPTC info in JFIF files.
	 - Lots of other features I didn't document at the time and can't
	 remember now.

1.6  Mar 10, 2002 by Josh Carter
	 - Now handles all flavors of JPEG for saving, not just JFIF.
	 (Most nobably it now supports EXIF.)
	 - Fix in CollectAdobeParts() that was corrupting files during
	 SaveAs() if they had an Adobe Resource Block. Sorry!
	 - Some proggies would save files starting the IIM section with
	 0x1c0219 instead of the usual 0x1c0200, so I allow that now.
	 - Fixed a couple stupid bugs in ExportXML.
	 - Now works fine with warnings turned on.
     - Fixed up HexDump a little and added other debugging tools.

To Do:
	 - Add credits list
