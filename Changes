Revision history for Image::IPTCInfo.

1.1  May 23, 2001 by Josh Carter
     - Properly packaged the module with makefile and such.
     - Fixed stupid byte-ordering bug on Intel architectures.

1.5  May 28, 2001 by Josh Carter
     - Major update with "real" JFIF parsing and can also
     create/modify/save IPTC info in JFIF files.
     - Lots of other features I didn't document at the time and can't
     remember now.

1.6  Mar 10, 2002 by Josh Carter
     - Now handles all flavors of JPEG for saving, not just JFIF.
     (Most nobably it now supports EXIF.)
     - Fix in CollectAdobeParts() that was corrupting files during
     SaveAs() if they had an Adobe Resource Block. Sorry!
     - Some proggies would save files starting the IIM section with
     0x1c0219 instead of the usual 0x1c0200, so I allow that now.
     - Fixed a couple stupid bugs in ExportXML.
     - Now works fine with warnings turned on.
     - Fixed up HexDump a little and added other debugging tools.

1.7  Oct 03, 2003 by Josh Carter
     - Fix for odd-length Adobe part at end of Adobe block (thanks to
       Ed Rossi for sending me files with this problem).
     - Added option to SaveAs() which lets you discard the other stuff
       in the Adobe block, which is useful if you have an image with a
       corrupted block (e.g. from IPTCInfo version 1.5).
     - Fixed stupid bug in Log().

1.8
     - Fix to conditional that was using bitwise & instead of boolean
       &&. They evalutated to the same thing in this case, but it was
       still a bug. (Thanks Brian.)
     - Reduced strictness of looking for tag/record/dataset at start
       of IPTC info. The spec says the version dataset is supposed to
       be first, but not all apps obey this. IrfanView in particular
       doesn't.
     - Couple options on saving for nuking the Abode block and another
       for nuking *all* application data blocks. You can ditch about
       10-15k worth of EXIF, FlashPix, etc. stuff without touching
       image data. (Feature requested by Scott at USA Today.)
